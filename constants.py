Numerical constants and tolerances for COIN_equality model.

Defines small and large values used for numerical stability and bounds checking.
Centralizes epsilon/bignum definitions to ensure consistency across the codebase.

NEG_BIGNUM = -1e30

# Small epsilon for numerical comparisons and bounds
# Used for:
# - Comparing floats to unity (e.g., eta ≈ 1)
# - Checking if values are effectively zero (e.g., fract_gdp ≈ 0)
# - Bounding variables away from exact 0 or 1 (e.g., Gini ∈ (ε, 1-ε))
# - Ensuring values stay strictly positive (e.g., A2 ≥ ε)
# - Root finding bracket offsets

# Large value for detecting effectively infinite parameters
# Used for:
# - Checking if y_damage_halfsat is so large that damage is effectively uniform
# - Detecting when parameters should trigger special case handling
